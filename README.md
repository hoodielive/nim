# Nim
This repository is for exploring the nim programming language. 
(source: Nim in Action by )
* Relative to Game development - Nim allows you to specify the amount of time that should be spent collecting memory which
	is dope because we wouldn't want garbage collecting to slow down frame rendering because it has to go here and there to 
	collect memory. 
* Nim can used alongside slower programming languages such as python and ruby relative to performance critical components.
  In that you may want to program partially in nim and then where appropriate and partially in the slower language where applicable.
* Nim also shines in performance relative to I/O operations - such as reading files or sending data over a network.
* Its dope for web application development also. See Jester or xarax. Nim supports async.
* Nimble is nim's package manager.

## Core Features
* Metaprogramming
* Style-Insenstivity
* Static Type system
* Fast Compiliation to C
* Different Garbage Collectors
